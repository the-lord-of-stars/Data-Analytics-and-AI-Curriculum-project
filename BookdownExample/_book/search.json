Whilst the equation environment follows conventional LaTeX syntax, R Bookdown does not support \\label, \\eqref to tag and reference equations. See the example below for how to tag and reference an equation in R Bookdown.\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \n  f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k}\n  (\\#eq:binom)\n\\end{equation} \n    \nConsider the Binomial Theorem \\@ref(eq:binom).\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k}\n  (\\#eq:binom)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nConsider the Binomial Theorem @ref(eq:binom).\n\n\nDo not use underscores (“_“) in your labels for cross referencing equations, or any other parts (e.g. tables, theorems, etc. which are discussed in later sections). If you have a label with multiple words, either just write them all in lower case, or use camel case, e.g. #PythThm instead of #pyth_thm.\nUnderscores are special characters in Markdown that are used to delimit italic text (see Markdown Basics), so using this character in labels causes a conflict.\n\n\n\nUser-Defined Commands\nYou may be the sort of person who likes writing your own LaTeX commands to save some typing. You can add custom commands anywhere in a .Rmd file and they will work in the expected way, as long as you define the command before its first use in your book.\n\nThe best place to define your custom commands is in index.md just below Line 16.\n\n\nDefining the following custom commands in index.md\n\n\\newcommand{\\rd}{\\mathrm{d}}\n\\newcommand{\\deriv}[2]{\\frac{\\rd #1}{\\rd #2}}\n\\newcommand{\\nthderiv}[3]{\\frac{\\rd^#3 #1}{\\rd #2}}\n\nthen writing\n\nConsider the differential equation\n$$\n\\nthderiv{y}{x}{2}+3\\deriv{y}{x}-y=0.\n$$\n\nyields:\nConsider the differential equation \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\\mathrm{d}x}+3\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}-y=0.\n\\]\n\n\n\nMultiple and Multiline Equations\nR Bookdown interprets the align environment in the usual way. You can tag each line individually to refer back to specific equations. Replace the tag with \\notag to suppress the numbering of a line.\n\nUnfortunately, R Bookdown does not support the subequations environment (e.g. for labelling equations 2.2a, 2.2b etc.)\n\n\n\n\\begin{align}\ng(X_{n}) &= g(\\theta)+g'({\\tilde{\\theta}})(X_{n}-\\theta) (\\#eq:align1) \\\\\n\\sqrt{n}[g(X_{n})-g(\\theta)] &= g'\\left({\\tilde{\\theta}}\\right)\n  \\sqrt{n}[X_{n}-\\theta ] \n(\\#eq:align2)\n\\end{align}\n  \nConsider the equations \\@ref(eq:align1) and \\@ref(eq:align2).\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\ng(X_{n}) &= g(\\theta)+g'({\\tilde{\\theta}})(X_{n}-\\theta) (\\#eq:align1) \\\\\n\\sqrt{n}[g(X_{n})-g(\\theta)] &= g'\\left({\\tilde{\\theta}}\\right)\n  \\sqrt{n}[X_{n}-\\theta ]\n(\\#eq:align2)\n\\end{align}\\]\nConsider equations @ref(eq:align1) and @ref(eq:align2).\n\n\nThere is a (possibly unavoidable) bug with the cross-referencing of multiple equations in the align environment. Whilst adding a label to each equation successfully adds a number to the equation where it is displayed, the hyperlink does not work for the first equation. In general, only the hyperlink to the final equation will work. In the situation where you have multiple equations and it is important to be able to individually reference each one, we recommend writing each equation in its own equation environment using the method in Example @ref(exm:EqRef).\n\nYou can use the split environment inside equation so that all lines in a multiline equation share the same number.\n\n\n\\begin{equation} \n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}) & =\\mathrm{Var}((X'X)^{-1}X'y)\\\\\n & =(X'X)^{-1}X'\\mathrm{Var}(y)((X'X)^{-1}X')'\\\\\n & =(X'X)^{-1}X'\\mathrm{Var}(y)X(X'X)^{-1}\\\\\n & =(X'X)^{-1}X'\\sigma^{2}IX(X'X)^{-1}\\\\\n & =(X'X)^{-1}\\sigma^{2}\n\\end{split}\n(\\#eq:var-beta)\n\\end{equation} \n\nSee \\@ref(eq:var-beta) for the calculation of \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta})\\).\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}) & =\\mathrm{Var}((X'X)^{-1}X'y)\\\\\n& =(X'X)^{-1}X'\\mathrm{Var}(y)((X'X)^{-1}X')'\\\\\n& =(X'X)^{-1}X'\\mathrm{Var}(y)X(X'X)^{-1}\\\\\n& =(X'X)^{-1}X'\\sigma^{2}IX(X'X)^{-1}\\\\\n& =(X'X)^{-1}\\sigma^{2}\n\\end{split}\n(\\#eq:var-beta)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSee @ref(eq:var-beta) for the calculation of \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta})\\).",
