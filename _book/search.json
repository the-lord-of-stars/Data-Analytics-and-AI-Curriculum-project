If you have a label with multiple words, either just write them all in lower case, or use camel case, e.g. #PythThm instead of #pyth_thm.\nUnderscores are special characters in Markdown that are used to delimit italic text (see Markdown Basics), so using this character in labels causes a conflict.\n\n\n\nUser-Defined Commands\nYou may be the sort of person who likes writing your own LaTeX commands to save some typing. You can add custom commands anywhere in a .qmd file and they will work in the expected way, as long as you define the command before its first use in your book.\n\nThe best place to define your custom commands is in index.md just below Line 16.\n\n\nDefining the following custom commands in index.md\n\n\\newcommand{\\rd}{\\mathrm{d}}\n\\newcommand{\\deriv}[2]{\\frac{\\rd #1}{\\rd #2}}\n\\newcommand{\\nthderiv}[3]{\\frac{\\rd^#3 #1}{\\rd #2}}\n\nthen writing\n\nConsider the differential equation\n$$\n\\nthderiv{y}{x}{2}+3\\deriv{y}{x}-y=0.\n$$\n\nyields:\nConsider the differential equation \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\\mathrm{d}x}+3\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}-y=0.\n\\]\n\n\n\nMultiline Equations\nQuarto Bookdown seems to not support the multi-ref environment in one equation.\n\nUnfortunately, Quarto Bookdown does not support the subequations environment (e.g. for labelling equations 2.2a, 2.2b etc.)",

You will see how Quarto Markdown treats them differently.\n\nThe files must either be in the same directory as your .qmd file(s), or you need to specify the path to the subfolder containing your image file.\n\n\nApproach 1 (Markdown)\nThis is the easier approach but the alt text is not as nice (we have cheated and written it as a caption).\n![Here is the caption](workers.png \"alt text\")\n\n\n\nHere is the caption text\n\n\n\n\nApproach 2 (R)\nThis is a slightly more difficult approach and requires the use of R, but it is better for “hiding” the alternative text.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=\"600px\", fig.alt=\"Here is the alt text\",\n    fig.cap=\"Here is the image caption.\"}\n    knitr::include_graphics(\"workers.png\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the image caption.\n\n\n\n\nThe student could view the alt text by right clicking on the image and selecting “Inspect Element”, or by using suitable assistive technology.\n\nThis is the preferred approach since we can distinguish between image captions and alt text. Also, we benefit from R’s automatic numbering of figures in their captions.\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Generating Images Using R (or Python)\nUse the following format to add R code. This adds the chunk below and you can add in R code. Python (or other languages) can also be added by changing the prefix to ‘python’ and change the setting accordingly (python setting).\n\n::: {.example name=\"Create Image Using R\"}\n```{r,fig.alt=\"A graph that shows...\", fig.cap=\"A graph demonstrating...\"}\nx&lt;-rnorm(100,mean=4,sd=2)\ny&lt;-x^{2}\nplot(x,y,lwd=4,main=\"Mock plot\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nx&lt;-rnorm(100,mean=4,sd=2)\ny&lt;-x^{2}\nplot(x,y,lwd=4,main=\"Mock plot\")\n\n\n\n\nA graph demonstrating…\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also hide code, so that graphs are produced without showing the code, or you can hide output so the code is shown without the results etc. see the Quarto execution options for more information.\n\nThe graph is produced but the code is hidden, by setting echo=FALSE.\n\n\n\n\n\nA graph demonstrating…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the code is shown but the graph is not shown using eval=FALSE.\n\nx&lt;-rnorm(100,mean=4,sd=2)\ny&lt;-x^{2}\nplot(x,y,lwd=4,main=\"Mock plot\")",

To suppress the heading number, add {-} at the end of your heading, e.g. ## Unnumbered Subheading {-}.\n\n\nLinks and References\nAdd a link to a url using the syntax [link text](link url).\n\n[School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mathematics/?target=_blank)\nSchool of Mathematical Sciences\nAdding ?target=_blank to the end of the URL forces the link to open in a new tab when clicked.\n\n\n Link to other parts of your book using heading names.\nFind out how to make [Links and References][Links and References].\nFind out how to make Links and References.\n\n\nWe recommend suppressing numbers from Heading 4 onwards.\n\n\n\nLists\nCreate unordered lists using the syntax\n\n* Item 1\n* Item 2\n    + Item 2a\n    + Item 2a\n\nWhich produces the output:\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\n\nItem 2a\nItem 2a\n\n\nSimilarly, an ordered list can be created using the syntax\n\n1. Item 1\n2. Item 2\n    a. Item 2a\n    b. Item 2b\n\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\n\nItem 2a\nItem 2b",

Whilst the equation environment follows conventional LaTeX syntax, Quarto Bookdown does not support \\label, \\eqref to tag and reference equations. See the example below for how to tag and reference an equation in R Bookdown.\n\n\n$$\n  f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k}\n$$ {#eq-binom}\n    \nConsider the Binomial Theorem (@eq-binom).\n\n\\[\nf\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k}\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nConsider the Binomial Theorem (Equation 2.1).\n\n\nDo not use underscores (“_“) in your labels for cross referencing equations, or any other parts (e.g. tables, theorems, etc. which are discussed in later sections). If you have a label with multiple words, either just write them all in lower case, or use camel case, e.g. #PythThm instead of #pyth_thm.\nUnderscores are special characters in Markdown that are used to delimit italic text (see Markdown Basics), so using this character in labels causes a conflict.\n\n\n\nUser-Defined Commands\nYou may be the sort of person who likes writing your own LaTeX commands to save some typing. You can add custom commands anywhere in a .qmd file and they will work in the expected way, as long as you define the command before its first use in your book.\n\nThe best place to define your custom commands is in index.md just below Line 16.\n\n\nDefining the following custom commands in index.md\n\n\\newcommand{\\rd}{\\mathrm{d}}\n\\newcommand{\\deriv}[2]{\\frac{\\rd #1}{\\rd #2}}\n\\newcommand{\\nthderiv}[3]{\\frac{\\rd^#3 #1}{\\rd #2}}\n\nthen writing\n\nConsider the differential equation\n$$\n\\nthderiv{y}{x}{2}+3\\deriv{y}{x}-y=0.\n$$\n\nyields:\nConsider the differential equation \\[\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 y}{\\mathrm{d}x}+3\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}-y=0.\n\\]\n\n\n\nMultiline Equations\nQuarto Bookdown seems to not support the multi-ref environment in one equation.\n\nUnfortunately, Quarto Bookdown does not support the subequations environment (e.g. for labelling equations 2.2a, 2.2b etc.)",

    "text": "2.5 Images\nWe look at two approaches for adding the same image. We add alternative text (usually referred to as “alt text”) in both cases. You will see how Quarto Markdown treats them differently.\n\nThe files must either be in the same directory as your .qmd file(s), or you need to specify the path to the subfolder containing your image file.\n\n\nApproach 1 (Markdown)\nThis is the easier approach but the alt text is not as nice (we have cheated and written it as a caption).\n![Here is the caption](workers.png \"alt text\")\n\n\n\nHere is the caption text\n\n\n\n\nApproach 2 (R)\nThis is a slightly more difficult approach and requires the use of R, but it is better for “hiding” the alternative text.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=\"600px\", fig.alt=\"Here is the alt text\",\n    fig.cap=\"Here is the image caption.\"}\n    knitr::include_graphics(\"workers.png\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the image caption.\n\n\n\n\nThe student could view the alt text by right clicking on the image and selecting “Inspect Element”, or by using suitable assistive technology.\n\nThis is the preferred approach since we can distinguish between image captions and alt text. Also, we benefit from R’s automatic numbering of figures in their captions.\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Generating Images Using R (or Python)\nUse the following format to add R code. This adds the chunk below and you can add in R code. Python (or other languages) can also be added by changing the prefix to ‘python’ and change the setting accordingly (python setting).\n\n::: {.example name=\"Create Image Using R\"}\n```{r,fig.alt=\"A graph that shows...\", fig.cap=\"A graph demonstrating...\"}\nx&lt;-rnorm(100,mean=4,sd=2)\ny&lt;-x^{2}\nplot(x,y,lwd=4,main=\"Mock plot\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nx&lt;-rnorm(100,mean=4,sd=2)\ny&lt;-x^{2}\nplot(x,y,lwd=4,main=\"Mock plot\")\n\n\n\n\nA graph demonstrating…\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also hide code, so that graphs are produced without showing the code, or you can hide output so the code is shown without the results etc. see the Quarto execution options for more information.\n\nThe graph is produced but the code is hidden, by setting echo=FALSE.\n\n\n\n\n\nA graph demonstrating…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the code is shown but the graph is not shown using eval=FALSE.\n\nx&lt;-rnorm(100,mean=4,sd=2)\ny&lt;-x^{2}\nplot(x,y,lwd=4,main=\"Mock plot\")",
